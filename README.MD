## The Hub

# fsa-cms
This is where our Sanity.io powered Content-Management System lives.

# react-web
This is where our React application lives.

# react-native

# Branching
The default branch is develop, while production releases are merged to master.
All new work should start as a new branch from develop, with merge requests created roughly 1:1 to ticket #s
We're following the git-flow model:

feature/TICKET_OR_ISSUE_NUMBER (feature/#43)
bug/TICKET_OR_ISSUE_NUMBER (bug/#102)
release/VERSION_NUMBER (release/0.1.2)
